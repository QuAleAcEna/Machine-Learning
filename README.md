# Machine-Learning
Data Science Project.
This project involves data processing, visualization, and machine learning using a dataset. The primary goals are to clean and preprocess the data, visualize important features, and apply machine learning models to predict outcomes.

Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
scikit-learn
You can install these libraries using pip:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Project Structure
The project is organized into several sections:

Data Loading and Initial Inspection
Data Preprocessing
Data Visualization
Decision Tree Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) Classifier
Cross-Validation

Detailed Description
1. Data Loading and Initial Inspection
The dataset is loaded using Pandas. Basic information about the dataset is displayed, including the first few rows and data types.

2. Data Preprocessing
This section involves handling missing values, converting categorical data to numerical, and scaling features.

3. Data Visualization
Several plots are created to visualize the data, including histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

4. Decision Tree Classifier
A decision tree model is trained and evaluated.

5. K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) Classifier
A K-NN model is trained and evaluated.

6. Cross-Validation
Cross-validation is performed to evaluate the model's performance.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the complete workflow of a data science project, from data preprocessing to model evaluation. Various visualization techniques are employed to understand the data better, and machine learning models are applied to predict outcomes.
